        <b>Mechanism of Dark reaction (Light independent 
reactions)/Calvin cycle</b><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark reaction does not require light 
energy, and it takes place in the stroma of 
the chloroplasts. The overall purpose of 
dark reaction is to convert carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere into carbohydrates 
or sugars which are used to power 
primary activities in plants and build their 
structures. The process of converting 
carbon dioxide into carbohydrates 
requires energy produced by ATP and the 
reducing power obtained from NADPH 
both produced from the light reaction. 
The fact that these chains of reactions 
are described as dark reactions does not
      imply that the reactions cannot take place in the presence of light. It simply means that light energy is not a vital factor in this phase of photosynthesis. The vital factor here is atmospheric carbondioxide, and the products of light reaction are ATP and NADPH. Dark reaction is therefore a synthetic
stage of photosynthesis.
However, such reactions, as cited earlier are
energetically dependent on light reactions 
        <br>  <br>&nbsp; The Calvin cycle  has three major phases which are carbondioxide (CO2
) fixation,
reduction of glycerate phosphate (GP), also called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), and regeneration of ribulose biphosphate (RuBP).
       &nbsp; &nbsp; <h6>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Carbon dioxide fixation</h6> 
          Carbondioxide
(CO2 ) used in dark
reaction comes from the atmosphere. It diffuses into the plant tissue via stomata pores located in the leaves or stems in some plants such as cactus. The absorbed CO2
is attached to a 5-carbon compound
called RuBP to form unstable 6-carbon compound by carboxylation reaction. The 6-carbon molecule quickly splits into two 3-carbon energy rich molecules called glycerate phosphate which, in principle are carboxylic acid, 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA or PGA).
        <br> RuBP is therefore called the carbon dioxide acceptor due to its ability to
accept or combine with carbondioxide. The reaction is catalysed by Ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase (Ribulose    
  biphosphate carboxylase) enzyme, which is abundant in the stroma of the chloroplast, and it
Carboxylation is followed by a chain of reactions which involve reduction of PGA
is usually abbreviated as RuBP
carboxylase, or RuBisCo, or Rubisco, or RuBPCase, or RuBPco. The PGA are the first stable product of photosynthesis and their formation marks the first major step in the fixing of carbon dioxide in green plants and photoautotrophic bacteria into energy rich molecules.

        <br><br>    
     &nbsp;   <b>2.Reduction of phosphoglyceric acid (PGA) </b><br>The reduction reaction begins when energy supplied by ATP and the reducing power of NADPH are used to remove oxygen from the PGA. This reduction reaction produces a 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde
(3-PGAL
or PGAL) also called glyceraldehyde phosphate (GP), which is a triose sugar (3-Carbon sugar) containing phosphate group.     
        <img src="Screenshot_20240515-202838.jpg" width="100%">   
    The difference between the PGA and the PGAL is that, the former is a 3-carbon acid (-COOH) while the latter is 3-carbon aldehyde (-CHO), therefore, PGAL is the first carbohydrate in photosynthesis which is a sugar with more chemical energy than PGA. It should be noted that the ATP and NADPH utilised in this phase of Calvin cycle are obtained from the light dependent reactions. The ADP and NADP+ return to the thylakoids to be converted back to ATP and NADPH, respectively, by the light reactions. One of the PGAL molecules is set aside to be used as a building block of glucose and other molecules such as sucrose, starch, cellulose, amino acids, fatty acids and glycerol. These products are used for various
biological roles
including respiration, building plant cell wall, building the body, and component of cell membranes. The majority of PGAL molecules will be forwarded to the third    
  phase of the Calvin cycle to regenerate RuBP consumed in the first reaction of carbon dioxide fixation.
        <br>    <br>   <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.Regeneration of RuBP</b> <br>RuBP is an important molecule utilised in the synthesis of sugars, therefore, it is necessary for plants to produce enough of it for synthesis of more sugars and other vital
molecules. RuBP is regenerated from PGAL, which combines with Ribulose
phosphate (RuP) molecules
as summarized in the equation below. This process involves a complex series of rearrangement
of carbon between sugar phosphates to atoms generate
5-carbon sugar from 3 carbon-sugar. The formed 5-carbon sugar (RuP) is then phosphorylated by the remaining ATP from light reaction to generate ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).
The produced
RuBP can combine with the additional carbon dioxide molecules and continue to the Calvin cycle reaction    </p>

        <br>   <br> <b>&nbsp;DIGESTIVE ENZYME MECHANISIM</b>
        <br> <br> Digestion is the process by which the body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used for energy and nutrients. The digestive system is a complex network of organs and glands that work together to carry out this process.<br><br>

The process of digestion begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva, which contains enzymes that start breaking down carbohydrates. The food then travels down the esophagus and into the stomach, where it is mixed with stomach acid and enzymes that further break down proteins.<br><br>

From the stomach, the partially digested food moves into the small intestine, where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. The pancreas secretes enzymes into the small intestine to break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The liver also plays a role in digestion by producing bile, which helps to emulsify fats so they can be more easily digested.<br><br>

The small intestine is lined with tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption of nutrients. Nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to cells throughout the body for energy and growth.<br>

The remaining waste products that cannot be digested or absorbed pass into the large intestine, where water is absorbed and the waste is formed into feces. The feces are then eliminated from the body through the rectum and anus.

Overall, the digestive system is a highly efficient and complex mechanism that allows the body to extract nutrients from food and eliminate waste products. Proper nutrition and a healthy diet are essential for maintaining optimal digestive function and overall health.

        <br><br> <b>MECHANISM OF ABSORPTION OF NUTRIENTS IN ANIMAL</b>  
        <br>
The absorption of nutrients in animals occurs through various mechanisms in the digestive system. These mechanisms include:

        <br><br><b>1. Passive diffusion</b><br> This is the simplest form of nutrient absorption where nutrients move across the cell membrane from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Small molecules such as water, electrolytes, and some vitamins are absorbed through passive diffusion.

        <br><br> <b>2. Facilitated diffusion</b><br> This mechanism involves the use of carrier proteins to transport specific nutrients across the cell membrane. These carrier proteins help facilitate the movement of larger molecules such as glucose and amino acids into the cells.

        <br><br><b>3. Active transport</b><br> In active transport, nutrients are transported against their concentration gradient with the help of energy in the form of ATP. This mechanism is used to absorb nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and some ions.

        <br><br><b>4. Endocytosis</b><br> This mechanism involves the engulfing of large molecules or particles by the cell membrane to form vesicles that transport the nutrients into the cell. This process is used to absorb larger molecules such as proteins and lipids.

Overall, the absorption of nutrients in animals is a complex process that involves various mechanisms to ensure that essential nutrients are taken up by the body for growth, repair, and energy production.      </p>
